# Application of a transcriptional pipline to investigate myotonic dystrophy
Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder assoicated with the expansion of the expansion of the CTG repeat 3' of the UTR of the DMPK gene. This leads to a gain of function for the resulting mRNA transcript leading to the formation of RNA foci, resulting in dysregulation of alternate splicing as well as RAN translation.

This project aim to perform differential gene expression (DE) analysis on DM1 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) samples to determine biological pathways assocaited with DM1 pathology as well as to determine any similarites between pathways effected between DM1 and ALS.
